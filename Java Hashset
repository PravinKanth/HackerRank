/*
In computer science, a set is an abstract data type that can store certain values, without any particular order, and no repeated values(Wikipedia). {1, 2, 3} is an example of a set ,but {1, 2, 2} is not a set. Today you will learn how to use sets in java by solving this problem.

You are given pairs of strings. Two pairs (a, b) and (c, d) are identical if a = c and b = d. That also implies (a, b) is not same as (b, a). After taking each pair as input, you need to print number of unique pairs you currently have.

Complete the code in the editor to solve this problem.

Input Format
In the first line, there will be an integer T denoting number of pairs. Each of the next T lines will contain two strings seperated by a single space.

Constraints
1 <= T <= 100000
Length of each string is at most 5 and will consist lower case letters only.
Output Format
Print T lines. In the ith line, print number of unique pairs you have after taking ith pair as input.

Sample Input
 5
 john tom
 john mary
 john tom
 mary anna
 mary anna
Sample Output
 1
 2
 2
 3
 3
